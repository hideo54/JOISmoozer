##How to use
1. Change line 5-8 as you like.
Format the problem number as {prb}, and input filename as {num}.
2. If you wanna use a language neither C nor Python, add a setting under line 19 as you like by using 'elif'. (and fork me on GitHub!)
3. Execute this program by Python. Input a problem number, and if no error appears, congrats, it worked successfully!
If a error happened, it'd be caused by either your setting or executed file. Judge from the error.
